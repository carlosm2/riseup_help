We love Riseup!
---------------------------
When was the last time we shared how much we love doing this? Today, we want to tell you! Running Riseup is truly rewarding. We get to engage with wonderful people doing incredible work in our help tickets, and we have amazing birds who bring their ideas and passion to our flock. All of this supports our mission of radical organizing! Some of us have been working to make the services that Riseup offers to help create another world possible for over 20 years. As individuals, we are committed to this fight for the long haul, and we deeply believe in the importance of secure communications for movement work!

One of the issues with running a project like this are the growing needs in terms of labor and costs. It really takes a lot of work to meet the requirements of a project the size that Riseup has become. Projects similar in size have 7 times as many people working, full time with benefits, to ensure their services are functional. And while stuff and things are continuously getting more expensive, we have not - we are a free service so we rely on everyone that makes use of riseup to keep the servers' lights glowing!

Everyone here at riseup looks at this as a labor of love and dedication to growing the world we know can exist. If you can, help riseup continue to flourish - https://riseup.net/en/donate

PS: During the coming weeks, as promised, we will share some of your stories with riseup - if you haven't written to us yet, there is still time: outreach@riseup.net



New helpdesk landing in January! 
--------------------------------------------------------
Riseup is getting older, 25 years old to be exact. In internet years that's ancient! Understandably, as time passes, some things get creaking and need attention. Our helpdesk has been grumpy for a while now and we've been working hard on a replacement for it so that asking for help gets easier. After much blood (the period kind), sweat and tears (also the period kind), we are finally done -- soon we will discontinue the old one and the new one will go live!

We have tried to notify whoever we were in contact with already about this change. If by any chance you had any help tickets open we want you to know that they will not be transferred and will be gone forever. After January 6 there will be a new helpdesk and you can open your tickets there. Don't forget, we are always glad to hear your feedback about it!

If you can, support riseup so that more creaking things can be fixed - https://riseup.net/en/donate
