In your own words
-----------------------
We wanted to know how you use riseup services and it seems the list of creative, radical uses of riseup infrastructure is endless! We received so many touching and inspiring personal stories, jokes, poetry, music, art projects and installations, suggestions for improvements, requests for merch and digital tools, and offers for help. You see, we knew what we do is important and necessary and we are so happy to know that you feel the same way:

"10 years of supporting people with access to safe and legal abortion. They write us everyday, we coordinate their travels and talk about our activism – the tools you provide make our work possible." - sends in a love letter a group rebelliously fighting for reproductive rights in countries where it is illegal, Europe

"The community [I am part of] has been a huge part of my life for 17 years now and I have loved every moment of it. Thank you for facilitating awesomeness for me – and many friends" - writes with passion a list admin from North America

"Thank you very much for the people behind this project, providing safe internet communication for radicals, activists and agents of social change. I am using Riseup since 2010, the same year we started our autonomous/anti-authoritarian space project. And now, for 14 years we still exist and I am still using Riseup." - shares with commitment for autonomy and decolonization, from an infoshop and community resource center, Southeast Asia

And this doesn't even begin to cover it. You showed us the range of political activity our relationship can create and we will share more with you about it in the coming weeks.

In the meantime, our hearts are full but our pockets are empty, so please help us by donating here - https://riseup.net/en/donate



You know those people that show up for you?

This is our last newsletter for this year's fundraising, so if you haven't had a chance yet and you would still like to, you know what to do - https://riseup.net/donate

When we started writing and sending you newsletters some months ago, our goal wasn't to just ask you for help with covering Riseup's basic needs. We also wanted to know your stories about being introduced to and using Riseup. Your response was moving, to say the least. We've already shared with you some of the stories we received in a previous newsletter but we were tight for space and left a lot of them out. We think that many more of them are important and show beautifully the relationship we have created together, so we would like to share them with you: https://riseup.net/en/about-us/newsletter/2024/25

Reading through your stories made us see ourselves in them. It reminded us of all the times we needed someone to be there and they showed up. So this is a big thank you to every single person that waited for us outside the jails, those that stuck around no matter the weather conditions for others to be released. Thank you to everyone we have conspired with, walked the streets, read your rants about political organization in obscure corners of the internets. Thank you for all the skill sharing, the patience, the criticism and the stubborness. Thank you for every direct action, for every festival we danced at, thank you for laughing and crying and yelling with us. Thank you for always being there for us. Thank you for every little bit that you do for yourself, for each other. Thank you for using Riseup, thank you for supporting Riseup.
